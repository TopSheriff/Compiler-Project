00:00:01,601 --> 00:00:02,835
Ted: Okay where were we?

2
00:00:02,837 --> 00:00:05,270
It was June of 2006,

3
00:00:05,272 --> 00:00:07,106
And life had just taken
an unexpected turn.

4
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:08,774
Dad, can't you just skip ahead

5
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,209
To the part where you meet mom?

6
00:00:10,211 --> 00:00:12,444
I feel like you've been talking
for like a year.

7
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:15,047
Honey, all this stuff
I'm telling you is important.

8
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:16,382
It's all part of the story.

9
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,883
Could I go to the bathroom?

10
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:19,318
No.
